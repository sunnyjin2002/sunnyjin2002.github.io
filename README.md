# Sunny Jin — Personal Site

A personal website to share background, interests, and highlighted projects in a single, easy-to-maintain place.

## Project Goals
- Introduce who Sunny is and what drives them.
- Spotlight professional experience, education, and selected achievements.
- Showcase personal projects with context, visuals, and links to source/live demos.
- Provide a hub for interests, writing, and ways to get in touch.

## Planned Site Structure
- **Landing / About:** Short bio, current role, key highlights, photo/headshot.
- **Experience:** Timeline-style overview of roles, responsibilities, skills.
- **Projects:** Cards or case studies with problem, approach, outcome, tech stack.
- **Interests & Life:** Personal interests, hobbies, community involvement, etc.
- **Contact / Links:** Email, social profiles, downloadable resume.
- **Blog / Notes (optional):** Space for essays or short posts if desired later.

## Tech & Tooling
- Static HTML/CSS/JS for full control (consider Astro, Next.js, or Hugo later if content grows).
- Responsive design with accessible typography and color palette.
- Use GitHub Pages for hosting (already configured via repository).
- Consider lightweight build tooling (Vite) if component reuse or bundling becomes useful.

## Visual Style Direction
- **Palette:** Soft neutral background with bright coral accent (`#ff715b`) for CTAs and highlights.
- **Typography:** `Inter` for readable, modern sans-serif across headings and body text.
- **Layout:** Centered content width (≈1080px), generous padding, rounded cards with subtle shadows.
- **Navigation:** Sticky top bar with brand lockup and anchors to scrollable sections.
- **Tone:** Clean, approachable, slightly editorial to balance professionalism with personality.

## Action Plan
1. **Discovery & Content Audit:** Gather resume, portfolio pieces, writing samples, media assets.
2. **Visual Direction:** Moodboard references, pick color palette, typography (Google Fonts).
3. **Information Architecture:** Solidify navigation, section hierarchy, and content priorities.
4. **Design & Prototyping:** Create wireframes (Figma/Excalidraw) for desktop/mobile breakpoints.
5. **Implementation:** Build responsive layout, deploy iteratively, add analytics/contact form.
6. **Enhancements:** Add SEO metadata, Open Graph tags, performance optimizations, blog engine.

## Next Up
- Flesh out detailed content outline for each section.
- Decide on final tech stack (pure static vs. framework).
- Draft initial copy for About and Experience sections.

## Local Development
You can open `index.html` directly in a browser for quick previews. Set up a lightweight dev server (e.g., `npx serve .`) for live reload as the site evolves.
